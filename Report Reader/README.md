Problem:
    Compiling various reports produced by labs in big industries is a
tedious and time consuming task

Proposal:
    Since most quality control and research reports use pre-made templates
and are recorded as pdf files    it is possible to automate this task.
As proof of concept this program will read an ExampleReport.pdf and
add its content to an xlsx file.
